The Women Who Code Portland - IoT Hackathon is back the weekend of Oct. 4 - Oct. 6! This year's theme is **Sustainable Homes**.

This event is geared towards women but we also welcome everyone who supports our mission of inspiring women to excel in technology careers. The goal of the IoT Hackathon is to gain new programming skills, have fun, and work in teams to build sustainable solutions.

If you are a seasoned professional ready to lead a dedicated team, this event is also for you!

We will be assinging teams on Friday based on everyone's experience and background. We do this to make sure all the particiapting teams are well-balanced. 

We will kick things off with a Sponsors Fair on Friday evening. This will be your opportunity to meet our sponsoring tech companies and learn more about them. We will get started with a welcome and IoT tech talks at 7:30pm. On Sunday, presentations will start at 3:30pm.
